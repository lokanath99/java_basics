multiple inheritance 
class A {
show()
}
class B {
show()
}
class C inherits A,B{

}

C ce = new C();
ce.show();//ambiguity problem
java dosnt support multiple inheritance 
-> interfaces 




this -> refering to the class variabls 
static -> to make any class elements class specific 
super -> used to call or use the super class elements 


over loading -> adding more arguments to the same method inside a same class
over riding -> having a diffrent method routines that a super class has // consists of same name as the inherited class method 



access modifiers

public -> accessed all over java project  
private -> only be accessed with in the class 
protected -> can be accessed by derived class and packages 


abs clas printer{
abs printing();
}


hp extend printer {

printing(String){
sysout(str)
}

}

canon extend printer{

printing(String){
sysout(str)
}


}


abs writing{ 
abs void write();
}
pen{
write(){
}
}
pencil{
write(){
}
}
class writeHelper{
	Writeable(Writing p ){
	p.write()
}
main{
Writing P = new pen()
Writing pe= new pencin();
writeHelper wh = new writehelper();
wh.writable()

}


types of interfaces
1. normal -> more than 1 methods
2. single abstract method(SAM) -> only 1 abstract method (functional interface)
3. marker interface -> no methods
